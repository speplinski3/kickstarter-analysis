# Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
This project is an analysis of Theater Kickstarter campaign data relative to launch dates and funding goals. The data is taken from a set of various Kickstarters with differing goal funds and success, failure, and cancellation outcomes.  

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to better understand the relationship between Theater Kickstarter launch dates relative to funding goals based on an exisiting Kickstarter dataset. The aim is to understand if there is an association with any particular launch month and the success or failure of reaching the Kickstarter's goals. Doing so will better inform the client of potential factors of Theater Kickstarter success and provide insight for future fundraisers.
